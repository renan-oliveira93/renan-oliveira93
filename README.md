### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

IÂ´m Renan de Oliveira, Fullstack developer, with a thirst for knowledge and a desire to share and contribute.

Today I work, among other technologies, in react.js, django, node.js, containerization with docker, searches with elastic search and graphQL, creating scripts in python for task automation and testing, always seeking to maintain all generic and reusable code in implementations, due to the large number of products that I currently work with, and the best SEO practices aimed at better user experience, better performance, and better ranking in search engines.

I also support the team with technical decisions, defining strategies for implementations, resolving incidents and possible impediments on a daily basis.

I bring experience from other sectors, where I held leadership positions, but now I have found myself 
 in technology.

I continue to advance in my studies, where I have published some projects...
